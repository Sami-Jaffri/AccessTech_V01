                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <h5>Students at UBC Okanagan</h5>
                <p> Our team is a group of enthusiastic and motivated students from the University of British Columbia who are passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on society. We are a diverse group of individuals, each bringing our unique skills and experiences to the table, and united by a common goal of bridging the digital divide.

                    We believe that access to technology and digital resources is essential for individuals to thrive in today's world, and we are committed to creating a website that can help to address the digital divide. Our platform will provide access to digital tools and resources that may not be readily available to those who lack the means or knowledge to utilize them, with the ultimate aim of promoting digital literacy and inclusion for all.
                    
                    To achieve this goal, we have conducted extensive research on the current state of the digital divide and the various factors that contribute to it. We recognize that the digital divide is a complex issue that affects different communities in unique ways, and we are committed to understanding and addressing these nuances.</p>

                <h5>Bridging the Digital Divide</h5>
                <p>Our primary goal is to bridge the digital divide through the creation of a website that provides access to essential digital resources and tools. The digital divide is a pervasive issue that affects individuals and communities worldwide, and our team is committed to finding ways to promote digital literacy and inclusion. By designing a user-friendly and engaging website, we hope to connect individuals across the digital divide and provide access to digital tools that may not otherwise be available. Our ultimate goal is to promote equal access to digital resources and opportunities for all, regardless of socio-economic status or geographical location. We believe that our website has the potential to make a significant impact in closing the digital divide and promoting greater digital equity.</p>

                <h5>What Can You Do?</h5>
                <p>The digital divide refers to the gap between those who have access to modern technology and those who do not, which can hinder social and economic progress. To help bridge this gap, individuals and communities can take several steps. Firstly, individuals can donate their old devices, such as laptops and smartphones, to organizations that refurbish and distribute them to low-income families. Additionally, communities can establish public Wi-Fi hotspots and computer labs in public spaces such as libraries and community centers, making access to technology more accessible to all. Education and digital literacy training programs can also be offered to help individuals learn basic computer skills and improve their understanding of technology. Finally, advocacy efforts can be made to encourage policymakers to invest in improving broadband infrastructure and expanding internet access to underserved communities. By taking these steps, individuals and communities can help bridge the digital divide and create a more equitable society.</p>
